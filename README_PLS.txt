~-_Hello peopleZzz._-~

This setup will be used first to check if the DB security is assuered.
at some point we should merge everything into this structure so it fits onto the docker structure.
there will be the following containers, if you have any thoughts on mind just HMU <3

- side remind - 
-> i will have to ask you what to install in the containers (or find it out), to of course assure it is running

-DOCKER COMPOSE-
-> Reverse proxy (nginx setup)
-> Frontend
-> Backend
-> sqLite
-> (maybe hashicorp vault)
-> (maybe monitoring software)

! To assure the communication between containers i will always use the standard for the according ports, so no need to change something (:^)__!
