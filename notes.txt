I want to write the game directly in JavaScript instead of Python.

The reason is that Python, especially with libraries like pygame, cannot run directly inside a web browser because:

Python code runs on the user’s computer or a server, but browsers only understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

pygame creates a separate graphical window using system libraries, which browsers do not support.

Therefore, you cannot embed a Python/pygame game inside a web page like index.html and have it run natively in the browser.

On the other hand, JavaScript is the native programming language of the web browser, so:

JavaScript combined with the HTML <canvas> element lets you create graphics and interactive games that run directly in the browser without any extra installation.

This makes JavaScript the ideal choice for building web games that you want users to play instantly on your website.

Additionally, JavaScript games can be easily styled, made responsive, and connected to online multiplayer features using web technologies.

For these reasons, writing the ping pong game in JavaScript is the best approach if you want it integrated smoothly into your website’s frontend.
